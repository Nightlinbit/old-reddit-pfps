## Acknowledgements

Forked from [LenAnderson/Reddit-Profile-Pictures](https://github.com/LenAnderson/Reddit-Profile-Pictures). This fork has a few changes
- Efficient downloads
  - Lazy loading
  - Caching (for repeated querying)
- Faster injection
  - This makes it look nicer while loading
- Embedded stylesheet rather than using style attribute.

## Installation

Install the script into a UserScript manager. The only tested manager as of 2022/03/30 is [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/). Please make an issue if you have any problems with other managers.
